          Visa and Entry Requirements
        </h3>
        <p>
          Traveling to Antarctica typically doesn't require a visa for the continent itself, but you may need visas for
          countries en route, such as Chile or Argentina. You'll need specific permits to land in Antarctica, which are
          usually handled by tour operators. For more details, refer to the official government websites of these
          gateway
          countries. Be sure to apply well in advance, as processing times can vary.

          Travel to Antarctica is primarily via cruise ships or expedition vessels, departing from ports in South
          America, Australia, or New Zealand. These ships are equipped to navigate icy waters safely. Consider the
          duration, cost, and comfort level of different vessels when choosing your transportation. Flights are limited
          and usually part of fly-cruise packages.

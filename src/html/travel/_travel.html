          <p>
            Traveling to Antarctica requires specific permits and documentation, though no visas are needed for the
            continent itself. Visitors typically transit through countries like Argentina or Chile, which may require
            visas depending on your nationality.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Permits and Documentation: Ensure you have the necessary permits, often arranged by your tour operator,
              which comply with the Antarctic Treaty regulations.
            </li>

            <li>
              Government Resources: For detailed information, visit official websites like <a

              Visa Application Guidance: Start your visa applications well in advance, typically 3-6 months before
